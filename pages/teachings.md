Internal structure of atoms, electronic structure, chemical bonding, and chemical properties of elements. Fundamentals of Thermodynamics and its application in Earth Sciences. Aquatic geochemistry, primary silicates and chemical weathering, acids and bases, dissolution and precipitation reactions, mineral stability diagrams, Eh-pH diagrams, oxidation-reduction reactions. The origin and evolution of Earth and the solar system through high temperature chemical processes, trace elements in igneous processes, modeling trace element partition during magma genesis. Radiogenic isotope geology and geochronology. Stable isotope geochemistry. Earth’s hydrosphere and its interaction with surficial rocks, sediments, soils, biosphere and the atmosphere.
