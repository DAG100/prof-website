# Glacial Hydrology and Landscape Evolution

We use various geochemical tracers to quantitatively constraint the sources of water in headwaters of the Himalayan Rivers. Our group is trying to improve existing and build new multi-component isotope and geochemical mixing models that could quantify the relative contributions of rainwater, glacial melt, snowmelt, and groundwater flow to the total discharge. We further focus on various types of chemical weathering reactions operating on the glacial catchment to understand the links between the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, glacial weathering, and the global carbon cycle. 

Some key findings of our research group include:

 - Discharge-weighted average ice meltwater contribution in headwaters of the Indus, the Ganga, and the Brahmaputra, varied between 47 ± 13%, 44 ± 13%, and 29 ± 10%, respectively, which is equivalent to 33.5 ± 6.5 Gt yr-1 of melted ice mass
 - HNO3-mediated chemical weathering reactions are important processes that alter the geologic carbon cycle of high-altitude glacierized Himalayan catchments as well as on a global scale.
 - Glacier fed small Himalayan lakes (≤0.04 km2) are a significant emitter of atmospheric CO2 controlled by DIC, and is an emerging—and not an inert—component of the regional carbon budget.
 - Planetary boundary layer height dynamics in the Indo-Gangetic Plains, which are far from the Higher Himalaya, modulates pollutant transport to the high mountains of the Himalaya.
 - Biomass-derived carbon could be the only primary driver of carbon-induced glacier melting in the western Himalaya.
