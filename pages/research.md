# Research Overview

Our research focuses on three main fields. Click on the links below to explore more about each field.

## Environmental Research: The Himalayas and Climate Change

We use long-lived radiogenic and stable isotopes to trace fluid-mediated surficial processes in the Himalayas. We focus on glacier-fed headwater streams, glacial impurities, water end-member source contributions to total river discharge, and water-rock interactions in the glacierized in Himalayan catchment. We try to address fundamental questions such as sources, pathways, and control mechanisms of surface water ionic compositions. These endeavors collectively aim to illuminate the profound impact of climate change on the delicate Himalayan ecosystem.

## Environmental Research: Isotope Hydrology

We study the influence of climate change, land-use land cover, and other disruptions on large rivers and groundwater resources. We try to address fundamental questions such as concentration-discharge relationships, chemical fluxes from land to ocean, sources, pathways, and controlling factors of dissolved constituents in rivers and groundwater using isotopic tracers.

## Translational Research

Our group aims to provide a cost-effective, scalable, and accessible solution to analyze and remove trace contaminants from water. We are developing technology that keeps communities safe from detrimental trace contaminants in drinking water by empowering them with actionable data and affordable solutions. We collaborate with researchers from MIT, USA and University of Waterloo, Canada for translational research.
