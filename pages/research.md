# Research Overview

Our research focuses on three main fields. Click on the links below to explore more about each field.

## Glacial Hydrology and Landscape Evolution 

We use various geochemical tracers to quantitatively constraint the sources of water in headwaters of the Himalayan Rivers. Our group is trying to improve existing and build new multi-component isotope and geochemical mixing models that could quantify the relative contributions of rainwater, glacial melt, snowmelt, and groundwater flow to the total discharge. We further focus on various types of chemical weathering reactions operating on the glacial catchment to understand the links between the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, glacial weathering, and the global carbon cycle.

## Dust Provenance and Transport Mechanisms in High Mountains of Himalayas

Our group has recently (2015) installed PM10, PM2.5, and PM1 (particles less than 10, 205, and 1 Î¼m in diameter) aerosol samplers at several locations including Kanpur, Harsil (remote village in Himalaya at 2500 m elevation) and Leh (Ladhak region) to understand the long distance transport and source of airborne particles in the Indo-Gangetic plains. We are using radioactive isotopes (Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd, U-Th-Pb, Re-Os) and trace element geochemistry in airborne particulate matters to understand their sources and pathways. The overarching goal is to combine aerosol geochemistry and atmospheric models to better understand atmospheric processes.

## Large River Systems

We work on large river systems to better understand land-to-ocean connections, chemical evolution of dissolved and particulate load from source to sink, and groundwater-river water interactions. Presently all our research activities are focused in the Ganga and Mahanadi Rivers.
