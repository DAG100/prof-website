# Environmental Research: Isotope Hydrology

We study the influence of climate change, land-use land cover, and other disruptions on large rivers and groundwater resources. We try to address fundamental questions such as concentration-discharge relationships, chemical fluxes from land to ocean, sources, pathways, and controlling factors of dissolved constituents in rivers and groundwater using isotopic tracers. Some key findings include:

- Uranium in the Ganga Basin alluvial aquifer system is geogenic in nature with bicarbonate complexation controlling its enrichment
- Dynamic sediment-water interactions in rivers possibly modify dissolved 87Sr/86Sr
- High resilience of heavy metals in large rivers
