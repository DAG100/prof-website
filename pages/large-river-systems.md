# Large River Systems

We work on large river systems to better understand land-to-ocean connections, chemical evolution of dissolved and particulate load from source to sink, and groundwater-river water interactions. Presently all our research activities are focused in the Ganga and Mahanadi Rivers.

## Ongoing Projects
