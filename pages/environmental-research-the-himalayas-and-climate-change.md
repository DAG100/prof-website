# Environmental Research: The Himalayas and Climate Change

We use long-lived radiogenic and stable isotopes to trace fluid-mediated surficial processes in the Himalayas. We focus on glacier-fed headwater streams, glacial impurities, water end-member source contributions to total river discharge, and water-rock interactions in the glacierized in Himalayan catchment. We try to address fundamental questions such as sources, pathways, and control mechanisms of surface water ionic compositions. These endeavors collectively aim to illuminate the profound impact of climate change on the delicate Himalayan ecosystem. Some key findings of our research group include:

- Discharge-weighted average ice meltwater contribution in headwaters of the Indus, the Ganga, and the Brahmaputra, varied between 47 ± 13%, 44 ± 13%, and 29 ± 10%, respectively, which is equivalent to 33.5 ± 6.5 Gt yr-1 of melted ice mass
- HNO3-mediated chemical weathering reactions are important processes that alter the geologic carbon cycle of high-altitude glacierized Himalayan catchments as well as on a global scale.

- Glacier fed small Himalayan lakes (≤0.04 km2) are a significant emitter of atmospheric CO2 controlled by DIC, and is an emerging—and not an inert—component of the regional carbon budget.

- Planetary boundary layer height dynamics in the Indo-Gangetic Plains, which are far from the Higher Himalaya, modulates pollutant transport to the high mountains of the Himalaya.

- Biomass-derived carbon could be the only primary driver of carbon-induced glacier melting in the western Himalaya.
