# Dust Provenance and Transport Mechanisms in High Mountains of Himalayas

Our group has recently (2015) installed PM10, PM2.5, and PM1 (particles less than 10, 205, and 1 μm in diameter) aerosol samplers at several locations including Kanpur, Harsil (remote village in Himalaya at 2500 m elevation) and Leh (Ladhak region) to understand the long distance transport and source of airborne particles in the Indo-Gangetic plains. We are using radioactive isotopes (Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd, U-Th-Pb, Re-Os) and trace element geochemistry in airborne particulate matters to understand their sources and pathways. The overarching goal is to combine aerosol geochemistry and atmospheric models to better understand atmospheric processes.
